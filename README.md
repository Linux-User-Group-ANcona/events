# LUGAN Events

This repository serves as the official archive and log for all LUGAN gatherings, workshops, and meetups, including past, current, and future events. It is essential for transparency and historical record-keeping.

## Repository Structure
Every event must be placed inside a dedicated folder contained within one of the following three.

**Naming Convention:** folders must follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD_EventName` (e.g., `2025-11-20_AdvancedPython`).

### Past Events
This folder serves as the official historical archive of all LUGAN events, workshops, and meetups that have been successfully concluded.

### In Progress Events
For better user accessibility, all temporally relevant events (currently running, imminent, or just concluded) are temporarily placed in this folder. This arrangement simplifies the process for visitors tracking our most current activities.

### Future Events
Events that are currently in the planning stage are still added to the repository using the required YYYY-MM-DD_EventName nomenclature. However, the date indicated is purely provisional and serves as a rough scheduling guide; it is therefore explicitly subject to change.

### 3. Workflow for Code-Based Events

If your event (e.g., a workshop) generates source code:

1.  **Create the Code Repo:** set up a new, separate repository (e.g., `workshop-python-code`).
2.  **Add Code:** push all the workshop code to that new repository.
3.  **Link Here:** inside the event's folder in *this* repository (`events/YYYY-MM-DD_EventName/`), create a simple `README.md` file that contains a direct, descriptive link to the new code repository.
